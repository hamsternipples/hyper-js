//
// that, potentially would make things a bit easier, but I dunno yet, so for now we pass `G`
// in the future, perhaps I want to instead make `this` become the `G`
//
// another idea is to store named contexts in `G` since we're already passing them around.
// the best thing would be to do both: store the named contexts in `G` and have local contexts as well.

// a section, really is just an observable that provides a context, then cleans up that context when it's done
